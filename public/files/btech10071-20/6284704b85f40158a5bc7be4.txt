Normal Variables in php starts with $ sign . eg $a,$myvar

A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.

A cookie is often used to identify a user. 
A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. 
Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. 
With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.

isset() ->The isset() function checks whether a variable is set if set then return 1, which means that it has to be declared and is not NULL.
$_SESSION['username']-> username is a session variable . 
$_COOKIE['username'] -> username is cookie variable .
$_POST['username'] -> username is post variable .
